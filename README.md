JavaScript Sliders for Mouse and Touch
=================

DEPRECATED & REPLACED BY: https://github.com/0la0/TouchLibJS

JavaScript prototype for creating intuitive and responsive UI sliders.

A slider can be either vertical (new VertSlider) or horizontal (new HorizSlider).  Each slider keeps an internal real value of [0 - 1].  By passing an "observation" function, one can remap the normalized value [0 - 1] to another domain.

The demoDriver.html file illustrates how to create and use the sliders.  Enjoy!
